# About jwt.show

The most user-friendly json web token (jwt) decoder around! All decoding is
done client side so your info never touches a server.

Paste a jwt in the input field and the payload will be decoded into claim names
and their values.

Some folks have asked: "Why not just use [jwt.io](https://jwt.io)?" Because
it's slow to load and annoying to use. But, yeah, that's just, like, my
opinion, man.
