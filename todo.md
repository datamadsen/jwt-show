# jwt.show

## Shareability
People who'd like to share a token with jwt.show should be able to
do so without the token benig logged in my server's requestlog.

## History
It would be nice to have a log over decrypted tokens, with some features:
- Easy access to see what was in a token.
- Part of the overview tells when a token expires.
- Copy token directly from history.
